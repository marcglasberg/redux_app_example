# AsyncRedux Project Template

This is a Flutter app
using **<a href='https://medium.com/flutter-community/https-medium-com-marcglasberg-async-redux-33ac5e27d5f6'>
AsyncRedux</a>** for state management:

* It's a full-fledged **example** with a complete app showcasing the fundamentals and best practices
  described in the <a href='https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux'>Readme</a>.

* You can also use it as a **template** to start a new project. Just delete the app-state, screens
  and actions.

Features:

* A clean architecture with layer separation: Business, Client, DAO.
* Connector pattern (no state management code inside of widgets).
  See <a href='https://luksza.org/2020/connected-widget-pattern/'>here</a>.
* Persistence (saving to the mobile device disk)
* Testing (including simulating the backend)
* Communicating with the backend
* Presenting errors to the user
* Checking the presence of an internet connection
* Navigation (between screens)

Coming soon:

* Localization and Internationalization

## Important

I used a similar app from the one suggested <a href='https://youtu.be/dc3B_mMrZ-Q?t=185'>in this
video</a> from Reso Coder (but there is Bloc, while here is Redux).
